world document digitization application. When digitizing
new publications, researchers usually do not generate large
scale ground truth data to train their layout analysis models.
If they are able to adapt our dataset, or models trained on
our dataset, to develop models on their data, they can build
their pipelines more efficiently and develop more accurate
models. To this end, we conduct two experiments. First we
examine how layout analysis models trained on the main
pages can be used for understanding index pages. More-
over, we study how the pre-trained models perform on other
historical Japanese documents.

the layout elements. The Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN
achieve comparable results, better than RetinaNet. Notice-
ably, the detections for small blocks like title are less pre-
cise, and the accuracy drops sharply for the title category. In
Figure 8, (a) and (b) illustrate the accurate prediction results
of the Faster R-CNN model.
